This research project is intended for the comparative analysis of visual odometry methods, in order to determine which ones are best suited to an autonomous submersible vehicle. in order to ensure accuracy and efficiency in a process of inclusion and exclusion of previously performed research available in the bibliographic reference bases (ie IEEE, Scopus, Web of science), a method was created for the analysis and selection of documents for systematic review of literature, in order to achieve the broader objective of this project, a low-cost prototype (ROV, underwater operated vehicle) was built to compare the results of the algorithms.
